      Roopkamal’s gentle spirit touched everyone who knew him. His laughter filled our home with warmth, his kindness softened even the hardest days, and his love reminded us that compassion is life’s most precious gift. He was a son, a brother, and a friend who dreamed deeply and gave freely. There was a light in him that made the world feel safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, behind his bright smile, he carried quiet pain — pain that words from others sometimes deepened. The world can be harsh to those with tender hearts, and unkindness can wound in ways unseen. We will never fully understand the weight he bore, but we will forever wish he had felt the same gentleness he offered to everyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Losing him has changed us. The silence he leaves behind feels endless, but so does our love for him. We remember the small moments: shared jokes, late-night talks, the way he could turn any day into something beautiful. Though his time with us was far too short, his impact will last forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his memory, we choose kindness. We choose to speak gently, to notice those who struggle quietly, and to live with the compassion he embodied. May his soul rest in peace, and may his story remind others that every act of love can save a life.
